Day 1/100 – Ethical Hacking Learning Challenge 

Cybersecurity starts with curiosity 🔎 — understanding how systems communicate, how networks 💻 are structured, and how attackers think before any tool is ever used. Ethical hacking is about learning these fundamentals responsibly to protect systems, not to misuse them.

Topics I explored today:
• What hacking actually means in the real world
• Different types of hacking
• Categories of hackers and their intent 🤠 
• General steps followed during an attack 🪜 
• How white-hat hackers approach security ethically

Key learning:
Strong foundations matter. Ethical hackers follow structured methodologies and legal boundaries to identify weaknesses 🛠️ and help organizations improve their security posture.
